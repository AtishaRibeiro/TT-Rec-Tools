# TT-Rec-Tools
This site brings together several tools I've made regarding time trial recording for Mario Kart Wii.
It is hosted on www.tt-rec.com using Netlify.
Although not required in the MIT license, it's still greatly appreciated if you credit me (Atisha Ribeiro/WhatisLoaf) when using code present in this repository.


## Code Details

Almost all the tools were written at different times and for different environments/sites so they do not all follow the same style/template. 
The CSS framework used is Bulma. More info at bulma.io
