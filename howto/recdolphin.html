    <p>
        There are 2 things that are quintessential if you want to record on Dolphin: <span class="tag is-success is-light">Dolphin</span> (obviously) and an 
        <span class="tag is-success is-light">MKWii ISO</span>.

        Downloading Dolphin
    </p>
    <p>
        Dolphin can be downloaded at <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/">dolphin-emu.org</a>. If you don’t know what version to download, choose Dolphin 5.0. 
        If you want to record in very high quality, download <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/0da8bd0f618de661dc32dcd1425ec6acc3db9faf/">version 4.0-8572</a> 
        (Warning: this can create very large video files.) T

    <p id="c_1" class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Getting your ISO
    </p>
    <p>
        The recommended way of obtaining an ISO is to create a backup of a real MKWii disc. This can be achieved with the Homebrew app <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CleanRip">CleanRip</a>.
        There are a few tutorials online on how to use CleanRip such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36nNq49tfSM">this one</a>.
        Note that, unlike what is suggested in the video, you can actually use sd’s/usb’s smaller than 8GB by setting the chunk size to something that will fit on your sd/usb.
    </p>
    <p id="c_2" class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Running your ISO
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to run the ISO in Dolphin, place the ISO in a folder of your choosing and then point Dolphin to that folder. 
        This can be done in Dolphin by going to <span class="tag is-info is-light">Options > Configuration > Paths > Add…</span> and selecting your folder. 
        The game should now appear in Dolphin and can be launched by selecting it and pressing Play.

        Getting your ghost file
    </p>
    <p>
        All ghosts are saved as <span class="tag is-success is-light">.rkg</span> files so you’ll need this file you’re trying to record. 
        If the ghost was set on CTGP-R it is as simple as going to <a href="https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/time-trials/original-track-leaderboards.html">Chadsoft</a>, 
        finding your time and clicking the download link at the bottom.

        Importing your ghost file
    </p>
    <p>
        To get your rkg file into the game on Dolphin we’ll need to import it into the savedata of the game. 
        To find this file simply right click on the game in Dolphin and select <span class="tag is-info is-light">Open Wii Save Folder</span>. 
        There you will find an <span class="tag is-success is-light">rksys.dat</span> file. From there, use the Ghost Manager on this site as explained in the <a href="https://www.tt-rec.com/howto/?page=ghostmanager">how-to section</a> .

        If your game is not running you can add cheat codes by right clicking your game and going to <span class="tag is-info is-light">Properties > Gecko Codes</span>. If the game is running
        it's best to go to <span class="tag is-info is-light">Tools > Cheat Manager > Gecko Codes</span> and add your codes there (shown in the video below.)

        This code will unlock all characters, vehicles and tracks. Use this if you’re running a fresh license and you haven’t unlocked everything yet.
        As explained in the post, you’ll have to edit the code so it works on your desired license.

        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        By default, in a ghost replay, players are shown transparent and mushrooms are not visible.
        Live Replay makes it so ghost replays look like they are actually being set live, hence the name.
        There’s a short explanation on the page but if you prefer a more visual explanation you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alYH761Olx4">this video</a>.

    </div>
    <p>
        At the start of a time trial the mii that is selected for the current license will show above the driver. This is likely not the same as the mii used in the ghost which can look a bit weird.
        Copy Mii is a code that lets you use the mii from that ghost as the mii for a desired license. As explained in the post, there are a few values you’ll have to fill in yourself.
        <a href="https://mkwii.com/showthread.php?tid=29">This post</a> explains how to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you’ve filled in everything, navigate to the ghost you’re trying to record. Activate the code (by pressing the activator button you chose.)
        Go back to the main menu and go to change the mii for your license. You’ll now see that the mii of the ghost is now an option, select it and you’re done!
        Note that when you restart the game, the mii will be gone. This means you’ll have to use this code every time you launch the game again.

        Recording

    <hr class="hr" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p>
        Finally, we’ll get to recording. The best way to record Dolphin footage is to dump all audio and frames. 
        This way it doesn’t matter how slow Dolphin runs so don’t worry if your pc is not the best.

        The <span class="tag is-success is-light">Internal Resolution</span> is set to 4x native but you can set this to your desired value.

        Dumping frames/audio
    </p>
    <p>
        When you’re ready to start recording, pause the game. This will ensure that the audio and frames sync up.
        Enable audio and frame dumping clicking <span class="tag is-info is-light">Movie > Dump Audio and Movie > Dump Frames</span>. Resume the game by pressing <span class="tag is-info is-light">Play</span>.
        The game will run notably slower because Dolphin is working hard to dump everything. When you want to stop the recording, disable the dumping the same way you enabled it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To find your dumped audio and frames, go to your Dolphin folder (which is usually located in your <span class="tag is-info is-light">Documents</span> folder) where you will find a <span class="tag is-info is-light">Dump</span> folder.
        Your dumped frames will be in <span class="tag is-info is-light">Frames</span> and the audio will be in <span class="tag is-info is-light">Audio</span>.
        In the Audio folder you’ll find 2 audio files: <span class="tag is-success is-light">dspdump</span> and <span class="tag is-success is-light">dtkdump</span>. You’ll only need dspdump.
        Copy the frames and audio to somewhere else as next time you start a dump, they will be overwritten.
    </p>
    <p style="font-style:italic">
        Note that if you’re using Dolphin 4.0-8572 the frames will be split over multiple files which can be combined in a video editor.

    <p  id="c_12" class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Editing the video
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you have your frames and audio, use a video editor of your choice and import them.
        If the game was paused when you started the frame and audio dump the should sync up automatically.
