        This tool generates a Gecko code that when enabled, replaces all leaderboards in the MK Channel with a custom created top 10.
        This is an off-line code, meaning only you will be able to see the custom leaderboards.

        Overview
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Region/Location
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="tag is-info is-light">Region</span> and <span class="tag is-info is-light">Location</span> drop down fields
        control your globe position. This can be useful when displaying Country/Regional leaderboards as the game will zoom in on the location you specify.
        When making a Worldwide leaderboard you can leave this untouched.
        The <span class="tag is-info is-light">Region</span> field decides what options are available in the <span class="tag is-info is-light">Location</span> field.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Title
    </p>
    <p>
        You can change the title that is displayed above the leaderboard by changing the text that by default contains the text <span class="tag is-info is-light">Worldwide Top 10</span>.
        By default the track name will be put in front of the title you fill in. If you do not want this simply uncheck the <span class="tag is-info is-light">Include track name </span> checkbox.
        Unchecking this checkbox can be useful when creating a leaderboard for a custom track. In that case you can include the custom track's name in the title field. 
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Entries
    </p>
    <p>
        You can manually set country, name, time and if the wheel was used.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Ghost/Mii files
    </p>
    <p>
        The main use of selecting a ghost or mii file is to get the mii to display on the leaderboard. If no file is selected a default mii will be used.
        Using a mii file (<span class="tag is-success is-light">.miigx</span>) fill fill in only the <span class="tag is-info is-light">Name</span> field, the rest has to be filled in manually.
        Using a ghost file (<span class="tag is-success is-light">.rkg</span>) will fill in every single field automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also select multiple ghost files at the same time. This will sort them based on their time and fill them in starting from the entry you pressed the button for.
        This means you can load in the entire leaderboard by clicking the file select button of the first entry and selecting 10 ghost files.
    </p>
    <p>
        After importing a ghost/mii file you can still edit all fields manually.
        This also means that if there's no ghost for a certain time you can just get the mii by loading in another ghost file from that person and then change the time.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Changing the amount of entries
    </p>
    <p>
        You can vary the amount of entries shown in game. Let's say you want a top 5 instead of a top 10. Just fill in the top 5 times and the tool sees it as a top 5.
        You can then also change the title to Top 5 if you want.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Highlighting an entry
    </p>
    <p>
        You can highlight 1 entry by clicking on the <span class="tag is-info is-light">Position</span> number. This will colour the row yellow to indicate it's been selected.
        In game this will colour that entry blue and give it a yellow outline.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold ">
        Using the code
    </p>
    <p>
        Once everything is filled in correctly press <span class="tag is-info is-light">Start</span>. This will generate a gecko code which for a top 10 will be around 100 lines long.
        Pressing <span class="tag is-info is-light">Copy</span> will copy the code onto your clipboard. From here you can use it like you would use any other gecko code.
    </p>
