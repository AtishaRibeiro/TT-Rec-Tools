        How to find your rksys.dat file
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Dolphin
    </p>
    <p>
        Right click on your mkwii game in Dolphin and click on the option <span class="tag is-info is-light">Open Wii Save Folder</span>.
        This will bring you to a folder which contains the rksys.dat file.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Console
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 2 main methods to get your savefile on console. Choose whichever one you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1.</b> Using <a href="https://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Riivolution">Riivolution</a> you can enable the option <span class="tag is-info is-light">save to sd card</span>.
        This will create an rksys.dat file on your sd/usb next time you launch the game (if it hasn't been created yet.)
        The rksys.dat file will be located in <span class="tag is-success is-light">riivolution\save\[GAME_ID]</span> on your sd/usb. GAME_ID varies depending on the region your game is from.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2.</b> Using <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/SaveGame_Manager_GX">SaveGame Manager GX</a> you can export/import your savefile.
    </p>
    <hr class="hr" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">
        Using the tool
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have your savefile you can import it into the tool either by selecting the file after clicking <span class="tag is-info is-light">Upload rksys.dat file</span> or
        dragging and dropping the file on the upload region. You'll only be able to work with the licenses that are available in the savefile you uploaded.
        If for example your rksys.dat contains 2 licenses you'll only be able to import/export ghosts from those 2 licenses. Optionally you can use a blank savefile which
        has 4 licenses with no ghosts.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Importing ghosts
    </p>
    <p>
        Press <span class="tag is-info is-light">Upload RKG</span> and select as many ghosts as you want. Alternatively, drag and drop the ghosts into the upload region.
        Select the license where you want your ghosts to be imported. You also have the option to choose whether the ghosts should be imported as pb's or downloaded ghosts.
        The following table shows the differences between these 2 types.
    </p>
    <table class="table is-fullwidth has-text-centered">
        <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Personal Best</th>
              <th>Downloaded</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Max 1 per track</td>
                <td>Max 32 per track</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Can be overwritten by setting a pb</td>
                <td>Can't be overwritten by setting a pb</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Visible on all 4 licenses</td>
                <td>Only visible on the current license</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Visible on the MK channel</td>
                <td>Not visible on the MK channel</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        <span style="font-style:italic"> Ironically, downloaded ghosts are not visible in the MK channel, the reason for this kind of complicated.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that you get 32 download ghost slots for the entire license. If you use all 32 on 1 track you won't have any more left
        for other tracks!
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Exporting/Deleting ghosts
    </p>
    <p>
        You can select ghosts and then either delete or export the selected ghosts. Exporting will extract those ghosts from the savefile
        download them for you. Deleting a ghost deletes it from the savefile.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Downloading your new savefile
    </p>
    <p>
        When you're ready importing/deleting ghosts, press <span class="tag is-info is-light">Save & Download</span> to download the edited savefile.
        Then replace your old rksys.dat with the one you just downloaded.
