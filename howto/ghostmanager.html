        How to find your rksys.dat file
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Dolphin
    </p>
    <p>
        Right click on your mkwii game in Dolphin and click on the option <span class="tag is-info is-light">Open Wii Save Folder</span>.
        This will bring you to a folder which contains the rksys.dat file.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Console
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 2 main methods to get your savefile on console. Choose whichever one you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1.</b> Using <a href="https://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Riivolution">Riivolution</a> you can enable the option <span class="tag is-info is-light">save to sd card</span>.
        This will create an rksys.dat file on your sd/usb next time you launch the game (if it hasn't been created yet.)
        The rksys.dat file will be located in <span class="tag is-success is-light">riivolution\save\[GAME_ID]</span> on your sd/usb. GAME_ID varies depending on the region your game is from.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2.</b> Using <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/SaveGame_Manager_GX">SaveGame Manager GX</a> you can export/import your savefile.
    </p>

    <p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">
        Using the tool
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have your savefile you can import it into the tool either by selecting the file after clicking <span class="tag is-info is-light">Upload rksys.dat file</span> or
        dragging and dropping the file on the upload region. You'll only be able to work with the licenses that are available in the save file you uploaded.
        If for example your rksys.dat contains 2 licenses you'll only be able to import/export ghosts from those 2 licenses.
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Importing ghosts
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply press <span class="tag is-info is-light">Upload RKG</span> and select as many ghosts as you want.
        You can import up to 4 ghosts per track (1 per license.) In theory you could thus import 128 ghosts at once (32 per license.)
        Once you've imported your ghosts, download the file and replace your old rksys.dat with the one you just downloaded.
        Next time you launch the game your ghosts should be there!
    </p>
    <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-semibold">
        Exporting ghosts
    </p>
    <p>
        When exporting ghosts you'll be able to see all ghosts present in the save file.
        Simply select the ghost files you wish to export and press <span class="tag is-info is-light">Export & Download</span>.
        This will convert all ghost files to staff ghosts and put them in a zip file.
